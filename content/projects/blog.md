I've been meaning to create a personal blog for a long time. I did some research
and decided to go with hugo. There's one main reason for using hugo over anything
else:

- amazing speed
- org-mode support out-of-the box
- :smiley: emojis?

As a matter of fact this post is written fully in org. I started with the
[quickstart guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). There's a
really great minimalistic theme
[cocoa-eh](https://github.com/fuegowolf/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme). After messing with
a config.toml and deploying to [github
pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) it was time
for some personalization. You can see beautiful avatar on the front page showing
my deep appreciation for animated series([South Park Avatar
Creator](southpark.cc.com/avatar)). Mongolian hat is the most important piece,
I happen to be one russian born mongolian :laughing:

Don't forget to enable emojis

```toml
enableEmoji = true
```
